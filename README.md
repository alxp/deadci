DeadCI is a lightweight continuous integration and testing server that integrates seamlessly with GitHub (other platforms coming). As the name implies it is dead easy to use, just run the deadci command and point your github webhook at the URL provided. DeadCI works by running a command of your choice at the root of repository being tested / built. It's easy to run [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) jobs from a `.travis.yml` locally. It also integrates nicely with [JoliCI](https://github.com/jolicode/JoliCi) to run yours tests and builds inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container.
